After some time, I've finally made up my mindShe is the girl, and I really want to make her mineI'm searching everywhere to find her againTo tell her I love her, and I'm sorry about the things I've doneI find her standing in front of the churchThe only place in town where I didn't searchShe looks so happy in her wedding dressBut she's crying while she's saying thisBoy, I've missed your kisses all the time, but this is25 minutes too lateThough you travelled so far, boy, I'm sorry, you are25 minutes too lateAgainst the wind, I'm going home again, mmm-hmmWishing me back to the time when we were more than friendsBut still, I see her in front of the churchThe only place in town where I didn't searchShe looked so happy in her wedding dressBut she cried while she was saying thisBoy, I've missed your kisses all the time, but this is25 minutes too lateThough you travelled so far, boy, I'm sorry, you are25 minutes too lateOut in the streetsPlaces where hungry hearts have nothing to eatInside my headStill, I can hear the words she said (hear the words she...)Boy, I've missed your kisses all the time, but this is25 minutes too lateThough you travelled so far, boy, I'm sorry, you are25 minutes too lateBoy, I've missed your kisses (I've missed your kisses)All the time, but this is (all the time)25 minutes too late (it's too late)Though you travelled so far (you travelled so far)Boy, I'm sorry, you are25 minutes too lateI can still hear her say...
